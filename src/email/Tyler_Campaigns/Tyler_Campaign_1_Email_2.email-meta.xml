{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName} here again from Livongo Health. I reached out a few days ago and didn&apos;t hear back, so wanted to drop you another quick line.

Livongo currently serves more than 50,000 members from more than 250 companies in the United States... many in the Fortune 100 and Fortune 500. Our client retention rate is about 98%, and the people that don&apos;t stay with Livongo often leave because they&apos;ve switched jobs and don&apos;t have coverage any longer. That speaks to the impact we&apos;re making for both employees and employers.

I&apos;d love to get a half hour of your time to discuss your current approach to diabetes, and how we may help. Please let me know your availability in the next week or two.

Thanks,
