    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I&apos;ve been trying to get in touch with you to snag a quick phone call to talk about Livongo, and haven&apos;t had much luck. This leads me to believe one of three things:

1) Lowering diabetes-related costs and improving the welfare of your employees is not a priority right now

2) You are interested in learning how we can help you lower diabetes-related costs and improve the welfare of your employees, but you&apos;re super busy

3) You&apos;ve been eaten by a bear

Whether it&apos;s 1, 2, or 3 - please let me know... because I&apos;m terrified of bears and would need to keep an eye out the next time I&apos;m in your area.

All the best,

Tyler Vandenberg
