    <textOnly>{!Contact.FirstName},

I tried to get in touch with you over the phone but didn&apos;t catch you at the right time, so I left you a brief voicemail!

As an HR &amp; Benefits professional, my guess is you&apos;ve discovered what a problem diabetes is for {!Account.Name} and your employees.

At Livongo Health, it&apos;s our mission to empower people living with diabetes to better manage their condition - and help companies like yours save money in the process. We have a program in place that leverages a patented technology with a very targeted coaching &amp; outreach component. Livongo is showing clinical results for the employees, and savings of over of $1,000 per person with diabetes per year.

I don&apos;t want to bombard you with attachments of our case studies right off the bat, but here is a link to some of our member and client testimonials that exhibit the power of Livongo:

If you&apos;re interested, I&apos;d be happy to send you over some of our case studies that show the impact that Livongo can have on cost savings.

I&apos;d love to give you an overview of our program. What does your calendar look like in the next 10 days or so?

Thanks,
