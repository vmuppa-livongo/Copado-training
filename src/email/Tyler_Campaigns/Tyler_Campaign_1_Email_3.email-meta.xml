    <subject>Did I mention the free diabetes testing supplies?</subject>
    <textOnly>{!Contact.FirstName},

I hope you don&apos;t take my professional persistence the wrong way. I certainly want to be respectful of your time, so I&apos;ll keep this brief.

1) Do you know how much {!Account.Name} is paying for testing supplies for each employee with diabetes each month?

2) Were you aware that Livongo members get unlimited diabetes test strips and lancets?

3) In addition to helping employees like yours live healthier lives, we&apos;ve been able to show a significant return on investment for employers.

I know I shared a couple of videos with you previously. Here&apos;s a video that shows the Welcome Kit that members receive after enrolling.

Again, I&apos;d love to get some time on your calendar in the next week or so. What does your availability look like? Please let me know.

Thanks,
