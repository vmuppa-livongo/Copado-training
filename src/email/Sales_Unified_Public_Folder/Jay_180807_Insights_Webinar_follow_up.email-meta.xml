    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I hope you were able to attend last week&apos;s webinar hosted by Livongo Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Jenny Schneider. If you missed it, you can watch the recording here.

The webinar covered the Livongo’s recently debuted Insights Report that is based on an analysis of approximately 20 million glucose checks. You can view the initial report here.

This report is one example of Livongo’s world-class data science platform that allows us to offer a personalized experience to all of our members. We will continue to use these insights to craft messages around seasonality and other blood glucose trends.

I hope you have a chance to watch the webinar and I would love to connect soon.

Thanks,

Jay Helmer
VP, Health Services Sales
