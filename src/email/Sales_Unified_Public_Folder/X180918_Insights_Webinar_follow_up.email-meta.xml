    <subject>Case Study: Livongo Improves Clinical Outcomes and Reduces Cost</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I am very excited to share our recent case study on how Livongo improved clinical outcomes and reduced diabetes costs for employees of Jefferson Health - Northeast. You can see the full case study here.

Jefferson Health Employees loved the program and gave Livongo a +67 net promoter score, which rivals top consumer tech companies including Netflix and Amazon. In addition, members experienced an average A1c reduction of 1.4% and sustained that reduction for over two years. Finally, we observed a 17% decrease in overall diabetes-related medical spend.

I would love to schedule time to discuss how Livongo can empower your employees to live happier and healthier lives while reducing diabetes spend for your organization.

Hope to hear from you soon.
