    <subject>Thought Leadership from Castlight and Livongo</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I wanted to share a blog post from our partners at Castlight health. The blog does a great job explaining the financial and clinical importance of managing hypertension, diabetes, and other chronic conditions. Castlight formed a strategic partnership with Livongo to address these concerns and because of their belief in our proven approach to managing chronic conditions.

The Livongo and Castlight partnership provides two key benefits:

An easy implementation process: Castlight clients can easily add Livongo into the existing Castlight ecosystem, saving time and hassles.
Improved enrollment and utilization: Castlight’s engagement and incentives programs naturally drive Livongo users to enroll in the program and utilize all of the added benefits.

I would love to schedule some time to discuss more about Livongo’s partnership with Castlight and how we are revolutionizing chronic conditions management.

Best regards,

Jim Hartman
