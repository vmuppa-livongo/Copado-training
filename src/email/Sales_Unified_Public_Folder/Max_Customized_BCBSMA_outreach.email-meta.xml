    <subject>Livongo partners with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I am excited to share that Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts will offer Livongo for Diabetes through their newly established Emerging Solutions platform.

The Emerging Solutions platform provides advice to employers who want to implement digital health solutions that effectively improve their employees&apos; health. The program is available to self-insured Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts accounts with over 1,000 employees.

I would love to discuss this program further and share how Livongo&apos;s chronic conditions management platform leads to improved clinical outcomes and measurable cost savings.

I hope to hear back from you soon.

Best regards,

Max
