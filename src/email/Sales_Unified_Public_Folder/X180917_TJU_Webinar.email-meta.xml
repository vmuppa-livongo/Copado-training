    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I thought you might be interested in attending our upcoming webinar on Tuesday, September 25th with Jefferson Health. During the webinar, Robin Sheldon, Sr. Vice President of Jefferson Strategic Ventures, will discuss how Jefferson Health successfully partnered with Livongo to improve clinical outcomes and reduce diabetes medical spend.

If you are unable to attend, I am happy to send you a recording of the webinar or schedule some time to discuss our case study with Jefferson Health and their results in detail.

Hope to connect soon!
