    <subject>Thought Leadership from Castlight and Livongo</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I wanted to share a blog post from our partners at Castlight health. The blog does a great job explaining the financial and clinical importance of managing hypertension, diabetes, and other chronic conditions. After launching our Hypertension management solution in January, Livongo became only digital health company to offer an integrated platform where people can manage multiple chronic conditions. Castlight formed a strategic partnership with Livongo because of their belief in our proven approach to managing chronic conditions.

The Livongo and Castlight partnership provides many benefits to employers but two that will directly impact your efforts are:

An easy implementation process: Castlight clients can simply add Livongo into the existing Castlight ecosystem, saving time and the hassles of adding a new vendor.
Improved enrollment and utilization: Castlight’s engagement and incentives programs naturally drive Livongo users to enroll in the program and utilize all its benefits.

I would love to schedule some time to discuss more about Livongo’s partnership with Castlight and how we are revolutionizing chronic conditions management.

Best regards,
