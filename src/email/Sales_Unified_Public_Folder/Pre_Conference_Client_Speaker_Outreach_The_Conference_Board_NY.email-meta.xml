    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

First off, congrats on being selected to present at the Conference Board. We recognize that this is an exciting opportunity and further proof of your thought leadership in the benefits community. [insert sentence on recent client-specific Livongo success]

We would love to see you at Livongo’s session, Proving Financial Impact and Business Model for Chronic Condition Management, on March 8th from 3:00 pm - 3:50 pm. Livongo Chief Commercial Officer, Jim Pursley, will join Magda Rusinowski, PepsiCo Director of US Health Benefits, to discuss Livongo’s clinical outcomes and measurable financial impact.

In addition to Jim and Magda’s session, please save the date for Livongo’s VIP event on March 7th from 6:00 - 9:00 pm. The event is hosted at the Attic, and we are co-hosting the evening with Castlight and Hinge Health. At the event, there will be plenty of networking opportunities, cocktails, and a fun appearance by the Bumby’s. If you haven’t heard of them yet, we aren’t judging, but they might be. More about this funky New York-based anonymous duo here. We feel that this will be a fun opportunity to set the tone for a great conference and provide a chance to catch up. RSVP for the event here.

We also want to sit down with you for an on-camera interview while at the conference to discuss your experience with Livongo. Our past testimonial videos have been extremely impactful with prospective clients and we would love to feature your feedback on the program.

Best regards,</textOnly>
