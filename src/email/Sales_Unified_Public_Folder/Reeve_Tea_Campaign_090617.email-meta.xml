    <subject>Following up on the Livongo Tea Package</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I hope this note finds you well and you&apos;re settling into your post-Labor Day routine.

I wanted to quickly check in to see if you received the tea package I sent your way?

I hope all is well at {!Account.Name} and I hope to connect with you soon to discuss the possibility of offering Livongo to your employees with diabetes.

Do you have a few minutes to connect over the next few weeks?

Kind regards,

ADAM CLAYPOOL
