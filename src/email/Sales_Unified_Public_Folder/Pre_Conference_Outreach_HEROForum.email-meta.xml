    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

On Tuesday, October 2, Dr. Anoop Sangha, Livongo’s VP Clinical Product Specialist, will take the stage at HERO Forum18 in a session titled The Proof is in the Peer-Reviewed Studies. In this session, Dr. Sangha will discuss Livongo’s proven successes in member satisfaction, clinical results, and cost savings outlined in Livongo’s peer-reviewed studies and scaled across our book of business.

If you’re at the Forum, it would be great to connect, and we hope you will join us for an engaging session.

Looking forward to catching up soon.

Best,</textOnly>
