    <subject>Launching Livongo for 1/1 â€“ Deadline Approaching</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

The deadline for launching your clients with Livongo for 1/1/19 is fast approaching!  Any client that is interested in Livongo for 1/1/19 will need to submit the Intake Form (see attached or find on Product Central) to Livongo by 11/28.  Attached you will find a flier that walks you through the process of taking your client from interested to ready to launch!

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me at kcardinale@livongo.com.

Hope you have a great Thanksgiving!
