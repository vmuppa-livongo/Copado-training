    <textOnly>Dear ((Contact First Name)),

I hope all is well at ((ACAP or Holmes Murphy}}.  We appreciate your support of Livongo with our shared client, {!Account.Name}.

This year, we have taken an important step in fulfilling our mission to empower all people living with chronic conditions, not just people with diabetes. We know that people do not manage their health in silos and that 73% of people with diabetes, which is the most expensive healthcare cost in the country, also live with hypertension. Our mission has always been to start with diabetes and expand to other chronic conditions, and in 2018, we’ve done just that. We’ve been hard at work to solve the issues that people living with hypertension experience such as unconnected data, inconvenience to measure, frequency of checking, BP education, and more. We are excited to share with you our Livongo for Hypertension Management program (see attached).

I would love to connect with you to talk about our new program for hypertension management and how Livongo and {{ACAP or Holmes}} Murphy can work together to improve the health of {!Account.Name}&apos;s employee population and save them money in the process.

Thank you, I look forward to connecting soon.


Stay Healthy,
