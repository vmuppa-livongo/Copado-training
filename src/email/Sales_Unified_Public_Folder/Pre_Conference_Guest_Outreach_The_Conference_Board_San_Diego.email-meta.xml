    <subject>Thanks for joining Livongo at The Conference Board</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

As we get closer to The Conference Board, I wanted to say thanks again for joining as our guest. If you anticipate having some free time time while in San Diego, I would love to schedule a quick meeting over coffee. It would be great to catch up and update you on some exciting new developments at Livongo.

At the conference, Livongo will co-host a session with PepsiCo titled, Proving Financial Impact and Business Model for Chronic Condition Management, on March 27th from 3:00 pm - 3:50 pm. Livongo Chief Commercial Officer, Jim Pursley, will join Magda Rusinowski, PepsiCo Director of US Health Benefits, as they discuss Livongoâ€™s clinical outcomes and measurable financial impact.

Looking forward to seeing you in San Diego!

Best regards,</textOnly>
