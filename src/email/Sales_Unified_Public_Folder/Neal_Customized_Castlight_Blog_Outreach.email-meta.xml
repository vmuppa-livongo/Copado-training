    <subject>Thought Leadership from Castlight and Livongo</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I wanted to share a blog post from our partners at Castlight Health. The post does a great job explaining the financial and clinical importance of managing hypertension, diabetes, and other chronic conditions. Castlight formed a strategic partnership with Livongo to address these concerns because of their belief in our proven approach to managing chronic conditions.
The Livongo and Castlight partnership provides many benefits for employers but two that will directly impact your efforts are:

An easy implementation process: Castlight clients can simply add Livongo into the existing Castlight ecosystem, saving time and the hassles of adding a new vendor.
Improved enrollment and utilization: Castlight’s engagement and incentives programs naturally drive employees to enroll in the Livongo program and utilize its benefits.

I would love to schedule some time to discuss more about Livongo’s partnership with Castlight and how we are revolutionizing chronic conditions management.

Best regards,

Neal Lewis
Vice President, Southeast, Livongo
