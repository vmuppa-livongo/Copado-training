    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Will you be attending The Conference Board in San Diego on March 27th and 28th? If so, I would love to schedule time to catch up.

At the conference, Livongo will co-host a session with PepsiCo titled, Proving Financial Impact and Business Model for Chronic Condition Management, on March 27th from 3:00 pm - 3:50 pm. Livongo Chief Commercial Officer, Jim Pursley, will join Magda Rusinowski, PepsiCo Director of US Health Benefits, as they discuss Livongoâ€™s clinical outcomes and measurable financial impact

As a trusted advocate of Livongo, we also wanted to invite you to shoot a camera interview while at the conference to discuss your experience with Livongo. Our past testimonial videos have been extremely impactful with prospective clients and we would love to feature your feedback on the program.

Looking forward to chatting with you soon.

Best regards,</textOnly>
