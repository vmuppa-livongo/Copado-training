    <subject>Announcement - Livongo Demonstrates Cost Savings for Employers</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I&apos;m reaching out today with some exciting news. We&apos;re starting to get our hands on medical claims data, which allows us to truly measure the impact of Livongo - and our data science team just released a study demonstrating a cost savings of $83 per participant per month.

$83 per participant per month!

This is a promising proof point, and it highlights why employers like Lowe&apos;s, SAP, PepsiCo, and Iron Mountain have implemented Livongo.

I&apos;d love to talk with you to learn more about how Livongo could impact {!Account.Name}.

Thank you.

Best regards,
