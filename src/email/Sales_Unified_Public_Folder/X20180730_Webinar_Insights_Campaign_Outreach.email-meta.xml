    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I wanted to personally invite you to Livongoâ€™s upcoming webinar on August 6th from 10:00 am- 10:30 am PT. During the webinar, Livongo Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Jennifer Schneider, will discuss how factors such as time of year, geography, and gender may influence Americans living with diabetes. You can register here.

These findings are part of a Livongo Insights Report series that recently debuted based on an analysis of approximately 20 million glucose checks. You can view the initial report here.

We used these insights to craft messages informing members of how to best manage their health during the Fourth of July holiday.

I hope that you can attend the webinar to learn more about how Livongo uses data science to improve the lives of our members.

Thanks,
