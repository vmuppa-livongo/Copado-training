    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},


Happy New Year! I want to invite you to attend Livongo&apos;s Signum conference this February. This one-day, invitation-only event will bring together thought leaders from healthcare into a meaningful dialogue around transforming healthcare for people with chronic conditions. We’re excited to have thought leaders like Daniel Pink, Hemant Taneja, and Seth Stephens-Davidowitz, as well as executives from Amazon, Walgreens, Delta, the American Diabetes Association, Anthem, Highmark, and Aetna.
