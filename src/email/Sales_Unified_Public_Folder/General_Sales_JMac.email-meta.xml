    <subject>Important update from Livongo</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

As a professional managing a large employee population, you are keenly aware of the extremely high and growing cost of diabetes in your organization.  This is where we can help you!

Livongo is a digital health company providing a innovative program designed to empower people with diabetes to live better.  Our offering will result in {!Account.Name} not only saving money, but will provide a better, world class service to your employees.

There is no upfront investment and likely comparable to what you are paying today…….and your employees get unlimited strips.....Here is how it works:

We use the industry’s first interactive, cellular-enabled blood glucose meter. We’ve turned the typical “dumb” glucometer into a smart device that doesn’t rely on wired or Bluetooth-based data uploads.   Our smart cloud captures information (numbers, behavior, activity), analyzes it in combination with other data about the individual, and provides that information in real-time to your employees care team – the person, the caretakers, physicians and the care managers.

Our Smart Cloud also sends data to our Certified Diabetes Educators (CDE&apos;s).  Your employees will have direct 24/7/365 access to knowledgeable and friendly Certified Diabetes Educators who listen, motivate, and guide them on how to manage their disease more effectively.  These CDE&apos;s will call within 60-90 seconds if a reading is dangerously low/high-Providing a real time safety net.

If you would like to learn more please do not hesitate to call or email at the contact information below.

My very best regards,
