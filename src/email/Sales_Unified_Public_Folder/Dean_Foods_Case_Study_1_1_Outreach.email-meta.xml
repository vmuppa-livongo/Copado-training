    <subject>Year One ROI Case Study</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I’m excited to share our latest case study that shows how Livongo helped Dean Foods achieve a positive Year-1 ROI of 1.4x on their investment in Livongo with $70 per participant per month cost savings. People on the Livongo program achieved a 5 percent medical savings while people who were not on Livongo program had a 7 percent increase in costs.

While we expect costs savings in three years, we’re thrilled we achieved this in one year. See the full study here.

I’d love to further discuss how Livongo can drive these types of results for your organization.

Best,
[Sales Team Member Signature]</textOnly>
