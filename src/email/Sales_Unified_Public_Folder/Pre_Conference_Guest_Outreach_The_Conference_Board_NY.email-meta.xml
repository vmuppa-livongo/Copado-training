    <subject>Thanks for joining Livongo at The Conference Board</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

As we get closer to The Conference Board, I wanted to say thanks again for joining as our guest. If you anticipate having some free time while in New York, I would love to schedule a quick meeting over coffee. It would be great to catch up and I would love to update you on some exciting new developments at Livongo.

While at the conference, we would love to see you at Livongo and PepsiCo’s session, Proving Financial Impact and Business Model for Chronic Condition Management, on March 8th from 3:00 pm - 3:50 pm. Livongo Chief Commercial Officer, Jim Pursley, will join Magda Rusinowski, PepsiCo Director of US Health Benefits, to discuss Livongo’s clinical outcomes and measurable financial impact.

In addition to Jim and Magda’s session, please save the date for Livongo’s VIP event on March 7th from 6:00 - 9:00 pm. The event is hosted at the Attic, and we are co-sponsoring the evening with Castlight and Hinge Health. At the event, there will be plenty of networking opportunities, cocktails, and a fun appearance by the Bumby&apos;s. If you haven’t heard of them yet, we aren’t judging, but they might be. More about this funky New York-based anonymous duo here. We feel that this will be a fun opportunity to set the tone for a great conference and provide a chance to catch up. RSVP for the event here.

Looking forward to seeing you in New York!

Best regards,</textOnly>
