    <subject>Livongo Partners with Largest Primary Care Group in Alaska</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

We wanted to share our recent announcement that Livongo has partnered with Medical Park Family Care, the largest primary care group in Alaska, and their health plan. These partnerships will create a seamless experience between Livongo and provider for the member while simultaneously ensuring an effective, scalable, and sustainable business model for Livongo, provider, and payer.

Livingo’s relationships with the country’s largest self-insured employers, partnerships with the two largest PBMs, and 4 of the top 7 payers in the country has allowed our 50,000 members to easily enroll in the program and feel empowered to live better and healthier lives.

Livongo’s Industry Leading Approach Drives Outcomes:

*Livongo NPS is +64 compared to Health Plan NPS of +12 and Amazon NPS of +69.
*75% of members felt more confident managing their diabetes after using Livongo.
*Livongo saved two self-insured employers $83 per participant per month on healthcare costs.
*Members of Livongo for Diabetes experienced a 21% reduced rate of non-emergent ER visits.

Our studies have clearly shown that Livongo is making a positive impact in the lives of our members and is saving payers money. I would love to catch up and continue our conversation on this topic. 

Thanks,
