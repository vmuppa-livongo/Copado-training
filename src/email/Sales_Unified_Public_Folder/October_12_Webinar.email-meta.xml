    <subject>October 12 Webinar: A New Look at Business Models for Digital Health</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I hope this email finds you well. Livongo Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Jennifer Schneider, was invited to participate in an upcoming webinar, A New Look at Business Models for Digital Health, and I thought it might be interesting to you.

Separately, I&apos;d love to touch base and see how things are going at {!Account.Name}. Are you available for a phone call the week of October 16?

More information on the webinar can be found here.

Let me know.

Thanks,

Adam Claypool
