    <subject>Exciting News: Livongo Launches Hypertension</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

You may have seen this morning’s announcement about Livongo’s expansion to hypertension. Cardiovascular care is the most important factor in avoiding the long term, expensive complications of diabetes and nearly 65 percent of people using Livongo for Diabetes also have hypertension.

We know that chronic conditions don’t live in silos, and by offering an integrated platform to manage both chronic conditions, we eliminate the need for members to use separate solutions. Livongo offers personalized insights on how they can better manage both chronic conditions, meeting the health needs of the whole person: mentally, physically, and emotionally.

I’d love the chance to share more about Livongo’s overall vision and expansion to hypertension.

Stay Healthy,
