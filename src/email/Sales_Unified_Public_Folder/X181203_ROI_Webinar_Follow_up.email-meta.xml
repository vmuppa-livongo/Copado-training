    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

For many Americans living with chronic conditions, the confusion, complexity, and cost of the healthcare system is overwhelming.

Livongoâ€™s Applied Health Signals engine reduces the financial burden for people with diabetes by making it easier for them to manage their chronic conditions. A recent case study showed 3.6x positive ROI for a group of large self-insured employers. You can learn more here.

In addition, our Value of Data white paper details how we use data to optimize the Livongo program for our members and prove return on investment

Thanks,</textOnly>
