  Hello&nbsp;{{{Recipient.FirstName}}}, 
  <br /> 
  <br /> I hope the note finds you well both personally and professionally. 
  <br /> 
  <br /> As we all spend more time in front of our screens and on Zoom, I thought you would find

  <b>'How to Avoid Zoom Fatigue While Working from Home'</b> helpful. 
  <br /> 
  <br /> My biggest struggle is setting boundaries around how many Zoom calls I can lead (well) in a day. I have found the number is 5, all separated by a brief walk and stretching session. 
  <br /> 
  <br /> Best wishes to you as you find your sweet spot that sustains energy and joy. 
  <br /> 
  <br /> Kind regards,
