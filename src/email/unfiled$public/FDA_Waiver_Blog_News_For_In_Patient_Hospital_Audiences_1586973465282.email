  <span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Hi {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},<br /> <br /> <span style="color:#e74c3c;">[NOTE - insert your specific personalization]</span>. As a nation, it’s encouraging to see the vast support for our healthcare heroes across the country, from thunderous cheers during hospital shift changes, to the armies of volunteers sewing masks to combat the PPE shortage. With some states reporting that <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2020-04-03/how-many-health-care-workers-have-coronavirus">medical staff account for up to 20-25% of all confirmed COVID-19 cases</a>, it’s vital to maximize their safety without sacrificing quality of care.<br /> <br /> To help keep America’s healthcare workers safe, the FDA has granted an emergency-period waiver to allow any inpatient facility in the country to use Livongo’s cellular enabled diabetes meter to remotely monitor diabetes patients. This <a href="https://www2.livongo.com/news/remote-monitoring-to-keep-americas-healthcare-workers-safe">major win for understaffed and overextended frontline providers will minimize exposure risk for staff and patients</a>&nbsp;by enabling care without the presence of a healthcare worker, slowing the burn rate of much-needed PPE, and freeing up resources for patients most in need of care.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Moreover, patients who use the Livongo blood glucose meter while in the hospital can take them home – at no charge – to continue managing diabetes effectively from the safety of their home (including complimentary home delivery of test strips and lancets). As <i>Forbes</i> reports, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/leahrosenbaum/2020/04/15/exclusive-livongo-helps-hospital-staff-go-hands-free-to-help-diabetic-coronavirus-patients/#c997646c7fd5">major healthcare systems are now turning to Livongo to support remote monitoring</a>&nbsp;and leverage&nbsp;the valuable biometric data our programs provide, effectively reducing pressure on strained facilities.&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Every day, Livongo empowers people living with chronic conditions to live better and healthier lives. We are proud to continue that mission and help protect our nation’s healthcare workers in this time of crisis.&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Stay healthy and safe,<br /> &nbsp;<br /> {{{Sender.FirstName}}}<br /> <br /> {{{Sender.Signature}}}</span>
