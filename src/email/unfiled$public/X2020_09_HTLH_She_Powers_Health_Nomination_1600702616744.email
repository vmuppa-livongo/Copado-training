    Dear {{{Recipient.FirstName}}}, 
   <br /> &nbsp; 
   <br /> For the second year, Livongo will be hosting the She Powers Health Awards during the HLTH VRTL conference. She Powers Health recognizes individuals who are making a significant impact on peoplesâ€™ health, empowering women and modeling diversity and inclusion in the workplace.&nbsp; 
   <br /> &nbsp;

Additionally, Chelsea Perry, Head of Community at The Advancement League and Operations Manager at MedStar Health was recognized with the She Powers Health Rising Star award for the accomplishments she has already made as a woman in healthcare early in her career. 
   <br /> &nbsp; 
   <br /> We are proud to present this award and highlight the accomplishments women have made in healthcare and in leadership over the course of their careers and more recently amidst the current pandemic.&nbsp;
