    Dear {{{Recipient.FirstName}}}, 
   <br /> 
   <br /> In recognition of your continued support of Livongo, I would like to nominate you for our new Client Reference Program.&nbsp; 
   <br /> 
   <br /> As a reference client you would be asked to talk to prospects via Zoom approximately 1-2 times per quarter, for 30-45 minutes. The call would likely cover your candid experience with Livongo including implementation, member success, and return on investment.&nbsp; 
   <br /> 
   <br /> Participants will receive a small token of appreciation for their time and effort, to be determined as the program matures.&nbsp; 
   <br /> 
   <br /> If you are interested in participating in Livongo’s Reference Program, please let me know at your earliest convenience.&nbsp; 
   <br /> 
   <br /> If you are unable to make this commitment now, consider whether you would be interested and willing to be featured as a Client Success Story or Case Study. We would be delighted to showcase your organization’s success. 
   <br /> 
   <br /> Thank you for your consideration. 
   <br /> 
   <br /> Kind regards, 
   <br /> 
   <br /> {{{Sender.FirstName}}} 
   <br /> 
   <br /> {{{Sender.Signature}}}
