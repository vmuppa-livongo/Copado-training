    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for taking the time to meet with the Livongo team! We enjoyed learning about [prospect] and [custom purpose/client needs].

We hope you see the value Livongo brings to our 600+ clients but don&apos;t take it from just us!  Check out this video of US Foods, Iron Mountain, and Windstream talking about ease of implementation, industry-leading member engagement, clinical results and cost savings with Livongo.

I look forward to working with you on silencing noisy healthcare for our members.
