  <br /> I hope you’re having a wonderful week so far!

  <br /> I’m sure you know this already, but almost 75% of total employer healthcare costs are indirectly driven by not addressing behavioral health issues. This leads to a $51 billion price tag on missed days due to depression alone. 
  <br /> 
  <br /> 
  <br /> Because of staggering statistics like these, I wanted to reach out to invite you to a webinar on 
  <b>Thursday, 3/5 at 12p EST</b>. 
  <br /> &nbsp; 
  <br /> 
  <br /> Two of Livongo’s SMEs will be hosting a short webinar outlining our how Livongo for Behavioral Health can help you deal with healthcare worker burnout. Julie and Rebecca will have 20 minutes to give you a 40,000 foot view and we’re leaving the last 10 minutes for questions.
