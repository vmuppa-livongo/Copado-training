    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

You might be asking, “What is Signum?” The word Signum is Latin for a bell tower that heralds news or signals a momentous new piece of information. On February 28, Livongo will gather preeminent healthcare speakers and visionaries in San Francisco, and I want to invite you to be a part of the conversation.

Why Should You Come?
Gain insights on how leading organizations across the country are addressing chronic-condition management now and their strategies for the future.
Find out answers to burning questions like “why is timing everything” and “what can Google teach us about ourselves?”
Join a movement that will address our healthcare crisis and provide smarter solutions to silence noisy healthcare.


Who’s Attending?
Benefits leaders from some of the most innovative U.S. companies including Amazon, Microsoft, MetLife, Walgreens, US Foods, SAP, and Target.

CEOs, Presidents, Chief Medical Officers, and other senior executives from leading healthcare organizations including Express-Scripts, Lockton, Anthem, the Biden Cancer Initiative, American Heart Association, and more.

Hemant Taneja, Managing Director of General Catalyst: One of the most successful venture capitalists in Silicon Valley and author of business best-seller Unscaled.
