<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;"><div style="width: 600px; margin: 0 auto;"><span style="font-size:14px;">Hi {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},<br />
<br />
<span style="color:black">We are grateful for your partnership and collaboration to empower people with chronic conditions to live better and healthier lives. At this point we have made Livongo services available to over 100 mutual clients and it is growing by the day.&nbsp;Thanks to all of you!</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color:black">As many of you have heard, Teladoc Health has completed its merger with Livongo effective October 30th. We’re excited about the companies coming together to create the leading whole-person virtual care organization.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color:black">There will be many future benefits to this merger and, in the near term, we want to confirm that&nbsp;<b>our relationship with BCBS Michigan remains business as usual.&nbsp;</b>Your current Livongo team continues to serve you and we will deliver on all of our commitments without disruption. Our Livongo branded programs and services continue to be delivered as usual and we will continue to create meaningful health outcomes and value for your clients and members.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color:black">If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to your Livongo rep or myself.&nbsp; Lastly, we have 7 weeks left in the year, let’s close a record sales year, ensure clean implementations and continue to serve our mutual members and clients with our best efforts as we have over the last 2 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color:black">Stay healthy and let’s close more business together this year!</span><br />
