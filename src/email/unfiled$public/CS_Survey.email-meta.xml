    <textOnly>Dear {!Account.Primary_CS_POC__c},

At Livongo, your satisfaction is of utmost importance. As we have recently launched Livongo for Diabetes, it would be helpful to us if you would take 2-3 minutes to provide feedback on the launch implementation process. This survey is extremely valuable to ensure our team and processes are of the highest quality possible.

To take the survey, please click here:
https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/LivongoClientSatisfaction

Feel free to reach out to me directly (information below) if you would like to provide additional feedback.

Thanks for your partnership.

Best,

Lynn Crowe
