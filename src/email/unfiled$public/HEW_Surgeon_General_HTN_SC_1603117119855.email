I just came across<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/10/07/surgeon-general-releases-call-to-action-on-hypertension-control.html"> this</a> article &amp; video that highlights Surgeon General Jerome M. Adams’ <i>Call to Action</i> urging Americans to recognize and address hypertension control as a national, public health priority.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The three overall goals to support improvements in hypertension control are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Goal 1.&nbsp; Make hypertension control a national priority</li>
	<li>Goal 2.&nbsp; Ensure that the places where people live, learn, work, and play support hypertension control</li>
	<li>Goal 3.&nbsp; Optimize patient care for hypertension control</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, the article cites how hypertension is all too common, as nearly 1 in 2 adults have hypertension, yet only about 1 in 4 have it under control.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.americashealthrankings.org/explore/annual/measure/Hypertension/state/SC">This site</a> by the United Health Foundation highlights that in the state of North Carolina, there are 38.1% of adults reporting that they have been told by their physician that they have high blood pressure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would be happy to provide your team a look into Livongo’s Whole Person platform which focuses on hypertension and how we can help achieve the goals that the Surgeon General has set forth for the American people.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have availability later this week. Does Wednesday or Friday work better for you?</p>

<p>In good health,</p></body></html>
